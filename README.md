# CS340-Dashboard

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I accomplish this by writing code with clear comments and even clearer variable names which greatly helps with adaptability and amintainablity. Beyond that I make sure to encaplusate functionaility into fucntions or methods that are clear and recgonizable so they are easy to use and update. This gave a great advtange using the CRUD library when working with the dashboard as I always knew what function to call and what I could give the function as input and what to expect as output. In the future I would use the CRUD module for largely the same thing but would adapt it to work with any database not just the AAC one.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approached this problem by thinking about making sure I understood the requirements and asked clarifying questions to ensure that I and the client are on the same page. I also made sure to examine what they were trying to do to build a usable and nice system for them to use. This is different from how I ususally design systems as I primarily work on the backend side of things so adapting my methodology to front-end/UI was a nice change of pace.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I like to say that computer sciencitsts are translaters, who take buisness/functional requirements from clients and turn it into a working system that a computer can understand and execute. This matters because computers allow us as a sociecty to offload a great deal of menial/mental labor and allow us to focus more on the big picutre when we're using robust software. In this example my work will allow Grazioso Salvare to better peruse their data and allow them to acoomplish their mission to train rescue animals much more effiecntly.
